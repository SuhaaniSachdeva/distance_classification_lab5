#### 1. What are the common distance metrics used in distance-based classification algorithms? 

ans1) Eucledian, Chebyshev, minkowski, hamming, cosine, manhattan

#### 2. What are some real-world applications of distance-based classification algorithms?
ans2) distance based classification can be used for image recognition, fraud detection, anaomly detection and many other classification problems

#### 3. Explain various distance metrics. 

ans3) Eucledian distance- classic distance metric(how normal distance is genrally calculated), Chebyshev-its called chess distance, moving diagonal has the same cost of moving forward and backward, minkowski-genralised distance it is different for diffrent values of p, cosine- diffrentitaes between angle between 2 vectors, manhattan distance- diffrence between the coordinates of 2 points.

#### 4. What is the role of cross validation in model performance? 

ans4) So that we can test the model on data points it has not seen before and test the accuracy and precision of the model with diffrent samplet sets.

#### 5. Explain variance and bias in terms of KNN? 

ans5)As k increases, we have smaller variance, however, the bias increases. As k decreases, the bias also decreases, but the model has high variance.Bias causes underifitting and varience causes over-fitting.
